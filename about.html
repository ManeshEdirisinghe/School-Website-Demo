            <h2>The History of Richmond College</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/richmond-building.jpg" alt="Richmond College Historical Building" class="about-img">
            <p>
                Wesleyan missionary Rev. George Baugh was the founder of Richmond College, which began its existence on
                1st May, 1876. Rev. Samuel Langdon was its first principal. The School was started with a staff of 8 and
                with 104 pupils on the roll.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Latin, Mathematics, Science, Arts and Religion were included in the curriculum, and children were
                trained to sit for British Public examinations. A prize giving was held in its very first year, and a
                library with 500 books was opened in 1878.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From these facts, it is evident that from the beginning, Richmond was conducted as a comprehensive
                educational Institution. The school which originally bore the name "Galle High School", was renamed
                "Richmond College" in 1882.

                        The first College magazine was published in 1887. It was only the second occasion that a school
                        in Ceylon had produced a magazine.
                        The same year, the English Literary Union was formed and cricket was started in the school.
                        In 1894, under the principalship of Rev. Hartley, the Old Boys' Association was formed.
                        Another important occurrence during that year was the establishment of the College Cadet Corps.

                            "Among the most important business transacted at the meeting of the Missionaries of South
                            Ceylon in the early months of 1876 in Colombo,
                            was the recent development of the work in Galle. Owing to zealous and preserving
                            applications of Mr. Baugh the authorities in England
                            had decided on the establishment of a Superior School for Boys at Galle under the charge of
                            Missionary and had made a liberal grant
                            for erection of buildings at Richmond Hill."

                    <h3>The Growth Period (1896-1922)</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Rev. James Horne Darrel assumed duties as principal in 1896. Under his brilliant leadership,
                            the school experienced both physical expansion as well as qualitative growth.
                            During his period, Richmond rose to be recognized as one of the best schools in the island.
                            At the local Cambridge Examinations of 1905, Richmond earned top position among assisted
                            schools and second place among all schools in Ceylon.
                            The same year, the Richmond–Mahinda Match was played for the first time, with the two
                            principals, Rev. Darrell of Richmond and Mr. F. L. Woodward of Mahinda, officiating as
                            umpires.

                        <p>
                            Rev. W. J. T. Small, who became principal following the death of Rev. Darrel, continued the
                            good work begun by his predecessor. Commerce was introduced as a subject in 1912, the same
                            year football was started at Richmond.
                            In 1915, the 2nd Galle (Richmond) Scouts Group was established. Scouting at Richmond enjoyed
                            remarkable success from the beginning. The first two King's Scouts in the island were
                            produced by Richmond. In 1916, Ceylon's first Cub Pack was started at Richmond.

                            A notable event during Rev. Small's period was the formation of the National Association at
                            Richmond in 1915.
                            It was, in effect, a forum within the school for the emerging nationalist movement and
                            reflects the liberality of thinking of Rev. Small.

                            In 1922, Rev. Alec Sneath took over the principalship of Richmond College. He was
                            responsible for many measures which brought refinement and qualitative development to the
                            school.

                            This was a period which saw major changes in the educational structure of Ceylon. The Free

                            was being implemented, and the school had to be geared to suit the changes.

                            In 1962, Richmond College, which was owned by the Methodist Mission, was nationalized.
                            Mr. D. G. Welikala, the first head of Richmond under state management, was also its first
                            Buddhist principal.
                            With the takeover, the Methodist Vernacular School on Richmond Hill was amalgamated with
                            Richmond.

                            During this period, considerable expansion and change had to take place to cater to the new
                            situation.
                            Richmond faced the challenge of transition so successfully that the then Minister of
                            Education commended Richmond on several occasions, describing it as a model institution
                            among nationalized schools.

                            Richmond was one of the first schools in the island to start the teaching of Agriculture as
                            a subject.
                            In 1969, she became the first school in the country to start an Agricultural stream for the

                    During the past 149 years, Richmondites have made a sterling contribution to the nation in various

                    But the pride of Richmond has always been its discipline. A Richmondite who learns the value of
                    discipline in school, takes this to society,
                    thereby becoming an exemplary citizen, irrespective of the social class he belongs to.

                            I made it my one great work next to preaching the Gospel to prevail upon our authorities to
